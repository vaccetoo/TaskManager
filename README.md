TaskManager

The main idea behind this project is exercising waht i have learend in my C# OOP course.

I have created simple Console App which enables you to easily Add, Delete and Complete new Tasks using this three simple commands on the console.
I wanted to challenge myself thats why i created Database which is txt. file, where the data is stored and every time you run the application the information from the file is loaded and ready to be used.

To start the app just run the code on your Visual Studio and use the commands Add (to add new task), Delete (ID should be an integer, to delete this task), Display (to see all tasks you have created on the console), Complete (ID should be an integer, to change the status of the task from Not completed to Completed). 

This is simple review of how you could use the app:

After all manipulations have been done this is the final state of the database:
